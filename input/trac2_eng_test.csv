C37.1,"shame on society & culture trying to justify their desire to live lifestyle
choices that are against humanity."
C37.2,"just wanna say, there is no gay gene. you can truly and seriously be cured by
accepting jesus as your savior. this gay agenda is everywhere on tv to
subliminally convince you to be interested to the same gender. oh and it's
also demonic. so it's spiritual as well. but if you keep yourself in the dark,
how will you prevail?"
C37.3,"well, if a one twin struggles with self confidence in a world where you should
be perfect, then both may come to the same conclusion. “because i’m not
meeting the standard, i’ll just be gay, so that i’ll fit in somewhere”. sperm
and egg are the scientific standard. all gay people can’t get over this. they
are mentally disabled."
C37.4,"i am an identical twin and we are both homosexual. we knew since we were like
4 or 5. the only thing that was confusing is the lack of information
pertaining to homosexuality when we were growing up. it wasn't on tv. it
wasn't in school education. it wasn't explained in our home. it was just this
mysterious wisp concept that you had to figure out on your own. it's pretty
traumatic for a child. thank god society is waking up from the ignorance of
sexual repression."
C37.4.1,"god wouldn't have said homosexuality is an abomination to him but then have
people genetically being born to have desires that go against him. the
absurdity behind that logic shows just how deranged that type of thinking is."
C37.4.2,"for lack of a better statement then i must say, ""i pity you immensely."""
C37.5,"just imagine if this world has gays that love to suck always! not designed by
creator but reprogrammed by the devil. destructive culture that will destroy
human societies!"
C37.5.1,demons and devils aren't real.
C37.6,no gay gene discovered recently. this man was proved wrong.
C37.6.1,"@rodney dodson without straight there wont be gays but without gays there will
be straight. and....there is no science that says there is no straight genes!
being gay does not evolutionize the human race because two gays cannot
procreate."
C37.6.2,"he's using the fact that there is concordance to posit that homosexuality can
be heritable. this is a perfectly rational thing to do in science."
C37.6.3,"there's no straight gene either. a gene doesn't turn you gay or straight. it
is however biological."
C37.6.4,"uhm: [1:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iejjszkflo&t=1m44s) bruv... he
talks about it xd"
C37.7,"homosexuality is a choice. if it is genetic, how can there be an increase over
the years of homosexuality if there ability to reproduce is dwindling?"
C37.7.1,"@mιss crαzy people, how dumb are you! everyone is born heterosexual thus it's
the standard. then later on there happens to be these people who just want to
be different for the sake of it and choose to deviate and become gay hence the
choice. to put it clearly then would be to say, 'everyone is born heterosexual
and then they face the choice whether to remain so or not.'"
C37.7.2,"@iihamed711 homosexuality is a sexuality. so if they think someone chooses
their sexuality, then that basically means they chose to be heterosexual too.
and if that's the case, you may not actually be straight  
coz noone chooses their sexuality"
C37.7.3,"@mιss crαzy the reason why people assume that homosexuality is a choice is
because by nature homosexuals cannot reproduce and heterosexuals can."
C37.7.4,"if y'all dumbasses think homosexuality is a choice, then guess y'all chose to
be heterosexual. and if that's the case, then hate to break it to you, but you
may not be straight.  
you do not choose your sexuality, homophobe."
C37.8,"this ""interviewer"" doesn't know when to stop."
C37.8.1,"of course, she's burkha dutt"
C37.8.2,"she didnt talk alot idiot. you should see other people. talking 10 minutes
before you answer and that happens 100 times over."
C37.9,"shut up, barkha! !!! interviews are not about you showing off!!!"
C37.9.1,she didnt talk alot
C37.10,am i the only one here who finds this guy incredibly sexy?
C37.10.1,"maria malhotra yes, but i am more of dying on the interviewers face. it looked
like a square. i was rolling on the ground 💀"
C37.10.2,yes ... lol!
C37.11,"ndtv dumbos want everything to support their ideological axe. dr. mukherjee is
an accomplished writer. this fool is asking some useless questions."
C37.12,"science has nothing to do with sexuality. its just they way they are born.
just like air or sun ,they are what they are! its 21st century ,deal with it."
C37.12.1,"@hadji mansour lol!!! well, i'm sorry that you don't like the facts presented
and that it makes you triggered!! xd but those are the facts and the problem
with you people are that you fail to tell me how something natural and
harmless (aka homosexuality) is somehow morally wrong. you have no argument
whatsoever on how it is wrong for me to be in bed with a man. you only say it
is because of your feelings period. :) just admit it, the left is absolutely
right on this. :)"
C37.12.2,"@mrworldguyseriously dude, ""homosexuality is a choice."" that's the problem
with you people, you keep on trying to look for loopholes to defend them with.
it is evident that it is wrong but you are so hell-bent on making an inclusive
society that overlooks weaknesses that you've got to the point that you now
overlook basic facts or try falsify or trivialise them. it's just another case
of severe cognitive dissonance"
C37.12.3,"@hadji mansour yeah no single gay gene. they said that forever. there multiple
gene's that influence sexual orientation so nice try."
C37.13,"barkha is only focused on getting the words out of siddhartha's mouth that she
wants to hear and that will bolster her propaganda, i doubt whether she even
understood the point siddhartha is driving home."
C37.13.1,gay is fake
C37.14,this woman talks too much!
C37.14.1,"she didnt talk alot idiot. you should see other people. talking 10 minutes
before you answer and that happens 100 times over."
C37.14.2,no she didnt
C37.15,interrupting the pulitzer prize winning author? you dumbo burkha
C37.15.1,you look so stupid right now
C37.15.2,he’s an imbecile
C37.16,"barkha - would it not be better to let the expert speak on the issue but no -
you have a nasty disease to put your personal idea forward during interviews.
it makes me wonder why on earth you are allowed to interview people. instead,
you should speak your mind, alone. this very nature of your coward attribute
to hide behind some one else to express your own thoughts disgusted me. hope
you understand."

C24.68,"<https://www.change.org/p/devendra-fadnavis-mentoo-needs-your-support-to-stop-
misuse-of-laws?signed=true>  
  
women misusing laws against men in india for extortion, manipulation and
revenge/vendetta has become an epidemic that not only threatens the moral
fabric of our society but puts lacs of innocent men behind bars.  
  
lacs of innocent men are languishing behind bars in overcrowded jails, and
there are no laws to protect them or legal body to hear their anguish and
support them.  
  
our constitution states that we are all equal irrespective of caste, colour or
gender. however, we have laws that only protect women and no parallel laws to
protect men. in fact, pro-women laws are being misused to victimise men and
men have no real recourse under law.  
  
we need to put deterrents in place to prevent misuse of laws, victimisation of
men, and also to ensure gender neutral laws are put in place.  
  
[#mentoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mentoo) with pooja
bedi intends to push lawmakers to draft legislation in parliament to create
checks and balances in society that give men and their families equal
protection under law and punishment to those who misuse laws.  
  
please note; [#mentoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mentoo)
is not anti [#metoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo).
women who misuse laws and file false cases are a deterrent to women
empowerment movements.  
  
what needs to change?????  
  
1\. name of accused to be kept as confidential as victims name until proven
guilty.  
  
a woman who files a rape complaint gets her identity protected but the men
carry the hashtag of
[#rapist](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rapist) from moment
case is registered. not just them, the women in their families be it mother,
sister, wife, daughter all bear the brunt of his rapist hashtag. shockingly if
case is proven false, no real punishment is meted out the woman who has
destroyed the life, career, reputation of the man and put him and his family
through mental, emotional and physical torture. punishment for the woman can
be a mere 500 rupees.statistics are shocking.  
  
data by the delhi commission for women states 53.2% of rape cases filed in
delhi between april 2013 and july 2014 turned out to be false.  
  
2\. rape/ domestic violence cases filed post 3 months of date of alleged
rape/abuse to be treated differently and arrest only after investigation of
the same.  
  
most fake cases are filed after deliberation, plotting and connivance with
friends, family and lawyers.  
  
statistics claim almost 75 % of dv cases are false and according to ncrb data,
10% dowry cases filed each year are proven false. there are over 11 lac men
languishing in jails implicated in false cases.  
  
in 2013, out of the investigated 1,12,058 cases, 10,864 were false. and in
2012, 10,235 out of 1,03,848 were proven false. after this data was released,
the supreme court had observed that the law meant to combat the menace of
harassment of women by their husband or in-laws was often being used as a
“weapon rather than shield by disgruntled wives”. the ipc 498a being a
cognisable and non-bailable offence only worsens the plight of those falsely
accused. sections 354, 509 and 376 are there to protect women, and not to
terrorise innocent men.  
  
3\. severe penalty to put in place for women who have been proven to have
filed a fake case as deterrent to others.  
  
please note: there is a distinction between an acqquital on grounds of
insufficient evidence and when it is a proven false case.  
  
4\. creation of national commission for men.  
  
if women have a body that addresses their issues we need one in place for men
as well. data states that for for every 16 women who commit suicide 25 men
commit suicide.  
  
5\. introduce purushdhan which will give a man the same economic rights and
footing as streedhan.  
  
many cases are coming to light of women marrying men and within a few months
demanding divorce and large sums of money. they threaten a man and his family
under sections of 376, 354, 509 and 498a if they don't comply. the assets a
man is given by his famliy or what he has earned prior to marriage should be
considered his. only what is earned during their marriage should be part of a
divorce proceeding based on number of years spent together and whether kids
are involved.  
  
6\. right to prenuptial agreements  
  
currently pre nups are not legal as it absurdly gets challenged under bonded
labour laws. men are increasingly shying away from marriage as it means
extortion. clarity on money will bring rights and respect to both.  
  
7\. to clearly define rape  
  
there have been judgements stating that if a man is in a live in relationship
it can fall under rape. promise to marry and not marrying is equivalent to
rape. rape is a heinous crime and laws for it are stringent. we need to
clearly define rape.  
  
8\. palimony to be taken as seriously as alimony.  
  
if a man is not earning and a woman is, he should be entitled to palimony with
the same respect and laws that grant a woman alimony.  
  
9\. gender neutral laws to be implemented  
  
when men face domestic violence there is no law to support them even if they
submit videographic evidence. same with rape. men on men rape and women on men
rape needs to recognised especically when rape is defined as intercourse under
threat/coercion. also for sexual harassment laws in the workplace to be gender
neutral.  
  
men in india have been imprisoned not only by gender stereotyping but also a
lack of laws and no official body to hear their cries. men are human. and if
we want an equal society, equal relationships, equal justice, we need equal
laws.  
  
please support our petition and lets push for equality and justice

C24.124,"women teachers r also responsible for this growing jihad against men.i.e,
feminism.they have captured our schools n education institutions, poisoning

male child in case he is raped by a woman!!!"
C24.126,"really true not only rape cases some womens are misusing domistic violence and
all other false cases.some women just want to take revenge or just they want
money. (a woman) already having extra marrital affair but are exploiting the
law made for their convenience.  
i am a girl but i have observed many of my freinds (boys) who are married and
are facing these false allegations.... and there is no firm law for them.if
they are guilty everyone point on them even media but when a woman proved
wrong in court but no one remembers it neither they are even warned for
misusing the law just because they are women."

C24.155,"another reason why equality is needed. and to make sure it exists actively, we
need to work towards justice, no matter what. false rape or rape..both are
acts of violence against a person. equality means unbiased judgement. equality
means accurate punishment. equality means justice for victims no matter what
the gender. in all these comments people are targeting feminists and feminism.
only if they stop hovering around the prefix will they understand why it's

C24.180,"i am confused.  
i mean why are we taking everything to such an extreme extent that it doesn't
even count as actions, it counts as reaction. for eg, women's equality pulled
to such an extent that it became feminism. rape word pulled to such an extent
that every women accusing someone becomes a rapist before even proven.  
we need to calm ourselves and must make our decisions as an action not as a
reaction."

C24.192,"finally, yes finally someone something about this. and i still wonder why not
stats like more than 50% of rape cases filed in this country are false. delhi,
the so called rape capital of india, had seen 43% false rape cases in 2018. in
false rape cases mein ladkiyo ko bhi tagdi saza honi chahiye, unki bhi image

C24.194.2,"yeah, buddy fake bullshit feminism sucks!!"
C24.195,"when we say right to equality means both the genders should be treated
equally.  
but because of majority of genuine rape cases a stigma has been born in the
mind that all men has no dignity and are dangerous to women or girls. that
stigma needed to be taken out. there are cases where male are also raped but
it is not a crime in the society because boys and men are worthless. and that
is where right to equality dies off.  
  
we need these kinds of movies in india so that people will know what is going
on in the world."

achhi hoti hai...yes i m girl i also have my brother father and husband i
truly admit in many case women rather then i say ""we"" women take
advantage....har ladka galat nhi ha....we just need to punished the actual
guilty...not on gender basis....and very clearly i m a student of

C24.308,"before women were suppressed by men.  
now men are suppressed by women.  
it's basic human nature if you give more power to anyone then that power will
eventually turn into evil.  
humans always try to take advantage.if they can suppress any one they will. so
every law should be made very carefully and loopholes must be fixed quickly.  
yes, woman are raped .that's bad and extreme punishment should be given to
anyone who rapes or tries to rape.  
but the harsh reality is that about 50% rape cases are false.  
they are in a relationship they have sex.that's normal.but the problem comes
when they break up. if it's a girl leaving a boy it's fine "" but"" if a boy
leaves a girl (breaks up with her) then that's a rape.  
a sex with both parties agreement is not a fucking rape.  
it's rape if you are forced to do it physically or be it mentally( harassment
/blackmail ).  
if a woman says ,""i did sex with him because he said he will marry her."" but
didn't marry because of some reasons. it does not show that man is a rapist
but rather it shows that she is a fucking gold-digger. he may be a fraud but
he is not a rapist.that's not rape.  
government should understand this."

women even know what feminism means or stands for? its honestly disappointing,
and mind you, this is coming from a woman. not only are these women giving
feminism a bad name, they are also making it harder for the real victims to

raped me.

but i think the scale of the two issues- actual rapes happening and the number
of false rape cases being reported should also be considered.  
while watching this trailer, the first thing that came to my mind is how
difficult it is a for a woman who's been raped to actually get an fir filed.
also, people commenting that women are considered innocent and men are
considered guilty is not true, since majority of the times women are blamed
for getting raped, that is, if they're believed at all."

judges should be ashamed of themselves for handing out mandatory prison
sentences to men simply being accused of rape and women more so for

C24.379,"great initiative. kudos. all sides need a voice to maintain balance of
judgement. but let's talk about most of the comments here that's like ' i take
this golden opportunity to give slippershot to feminists'. kindly tell me, are
feminists conspiring and encouraging women to file fake cases? how is this
even a logical inference.  
  
people hear about false cases and simply assume it's just women exacting
revenge or exhorting money. in reality, the reasons are so much more complex.  
  
majority of false cases (according to the delhi study) are filed by parents of
eloping daughters especially if the boy belongs to another community or
religion in order to end their relationship. and these cases were then deemed
false because of testimony of the girl involved.  
false cases with women doing out of revenge is really the least common type.
but people talking about false cases only zoom in on this type.  
  
truth is we don't really have much reliable post verdict data of all this.
there's only this one study that too conducted for delhi courts alone. we need
to press for more data and research of into this area (root causes) to amend
the rape laws in a way that's justifiable. one of the amendments i would
support is removing 'breach of promise of marriage'  
  
please understand increase in fake cases do not correspond to decrease in real
rape cases. according to nhfs and ncrb reports not even 1℅ of sexual assaults
even get reported. i have interracted with rape victims and inspite of all the
laws favoring women, victims still find it difficult to navigate the legal and
social system after a rape. they are very ofen shut up, threatened and shamed.
there's a systemic problem of underreporting of rape.  
  
often in an attempt to support false case victims, people end up undermining
the frequency and severity of rape in the process.  
  
it's a good thing, fake cases are coming to light and people are fighting for
justice where it's warranted. but a fight for more fair treatment of men need
not necessarily turn into a stupid fight against feminism.

C24.515,"today, when people ask me, ""do you support feminism?"", i reply with, ""no, i
support equality"".  
the reason is, feminism has changed its meaning over the course of past few
decades. there are real women struggling in the corners of the world who
really need feminism to improve their lives. and then there are other rich
women, possessing everything, living in the urban areas and have learned about
feminisim from the ellen show. this ain't equality, people. this is called
pseudo-feminism and mostly lead by feminazis, who don't know that true
feminism meant equality for girls, not making them superior, men-hating living
beings.  
btw, the red pill (2016) is a great documentary to watch for interested
people. and don't hate women for this, else, we're gonna be the same. we
opposite sexes are meant to compliment each other.

was saying women are superior to men, were superior, and will be superior.
imagine if this was revered where a woman says that men are superior to women
in a tv program, there would be a massive social outrage and the tv channel
would lose its license. this proves that we are living in a female dominated
society where men have very few rights. while women can commit crimes and get
away with it. and feminism is about female dominated and male subjugation. not
about gender equality as it claims to be."

!five bloody years has passed i had been stuck in this gender biased law,five
years back i was an ceo of an company i build from scrap,i bought my first car
and brand new suv from showroom,i had plans to expand my business to india
from middle east so that i can contribute towards the job market of my country
an advice i kept in my mind from an cousin of an friend i met in qatar when i
was in just 8th grade, i was proud of myself ,my parents were proud of me ,my
relatives were proud of me ,i used to feel the respect people used to give me
whenever i entered somewhere i was just 32 years ,but evere since this bloody
fake cases started against me i lost one by one everything , wasn't able to
move forward lost opportunities due to these bloody court dates,people started
using the opportunity to loot me knowingly i didn't want to fight with then
because i was already fighting an unwanted battle back in indian courts ,from
500k income per month to bankruptcy is what i am facing today,i am already ill
my energy is half of what i used to have before back on those days when i
started my business for first time i used to work till 2 am or sometimes till
3 am and sleep just for 3 to 4 hrs a days today i can't strain that much
because i am already stressed out in my life due to the courts and hearing i
get tired soon ,i have proof for everything each and every punctuation marks
in the petitioners petition is lie i even have video and audio proofs to prove
my innocence,rti reports to prove forged documents were filed with the help of
cops to frame me in false cases ,but when will i get the opportunity to prove
it all false? only when the bloody trial starts until then i am guilty ,
""innocent until proven guilty "" is an joke in our judiciary when it comes to
gender biased law's the judge's, cops etc somehow love to torture innocent men
and the worst thing is i have to fight the bloody feminist organizations too,
members for these organizations are torturing my family members also ,they are
threatening ,they even threathened my wife before my marriage knowing my
tragic life she stood for me and didn't dump me she was threatened by an lady
from some feminist organizations for marrying me she was even insulted at her
college because these ladies called and told all lies to her lectures she
discontinued her studies then ,is this women empowerment?,today i lost
everything my mom is more ill now ,my dad is always sad and became weak ,my
sister is sad ?,i can't face people because of my failure ,i am planning to
sell my car for hanging on somehow ,no chances for even an good job because of
the bloody criminal case against me i knwo i will win the case in the end but
then what use ? will i get all these years back ? will i get my life back?will
i get my youth back?what justice is this fight against false case for years
and in the end prove ur innocence but loose everything you had ,why ain't
courts punishing these women who file false cases in the end it's just aquital

by exploiting the law?."

accused a man. many times women says that think of your sister, father and
mother, but by these false cases we can say that before make false accusations
think of your brother, father and son."

been reading through the comments, now that ye topic uth gaya h to, ""ye bhi
sahi h, lekin sirf yahi sahi nahi hai"" , and most people are saying, ""a man is
guilty until proven innocent, and a women is innocent until proven guilty""
this is completely not true , well in many cases this might be true, but in
many cases a girl stigmatized as raped or even harassed becomes useless goods
to the society, believe it or not, such things leaves trauma for lifetime,
well not that every man is trash, but on which side the aftermaths are severe
we do all know.  
some people do misuse their rights for protection but in some cases conditions
are twisted to the core , if some people misuse their rights then of course
some misuse the sympathy they receive , there are all kind of people around
with much more twisted ideology or just simple minded."

punishable (50,000 fine was imposed the most recent one) and our dear country
penetration has to be there for most cases which is why a lot of these
assholes aren't prosecuted. sexual harrassment isn't punishable in most cases.
look at our laws.  
most rape cases go unreported. and to all of you who havent traveled by public
transport? you don't know how bad it is. bollywood promotes harrasment, just
look at our song lyrics, ""gandi baat"" is literally about rape and glorifying
it.i'm so done with this shit."

years.. and nobody is even hearing them out.. if women on the road deserve

C24.638,"not just false rape cases, but there are thousands of men who are a victim of
manipulation, gaslighting and severe mental traumatization by innumerable
women just because they are 'women' and they believe they can go by anything.
if a man tries to overpower a woman, he is considered as a bully and the case
is registered as 'domestic abuse'. what about thousands of men who are being
dominated and overpowered by toxic women? what about those men who are
belittled or mentally abused or are accused of every wrong action even if they
haven't done it? thanks for this documentary. much needed."

me , i don't anyone in my known one who raped anyone or i don't know anyone
who had been raped in my known one.  
but i know 4-5 incident in known circle who have falsely accused of
molestation, fake dowry, and i had seen their families suffered so much till
date. i completely support this documentary.  
  
how hard is for you to write "" may the innocent irrespective of their gender
get the justice"""
C24.669,"this is such a sensitive topic in which you can never take a side. you would
never know what happened either if it is a boy or a girl. there were tons of
cases, where the rapist was not punished, but also many many innocent were
punished.the one and only solution for this is self realization... one should
have a great wisdom on how to behave. vengeance and immorality is simply
should not be accepted. one should be scared of something to stop such
behaviors. in olden days, we believed in god where we were taught that god was
always watching over us and we should behave but now it has become a fashion
to say that ""i'm atheist"". and in the society we need 2 things. one.... every
one should be taught moral values starting from school. next..... there should
be strong rules, that favors justice and not gender. and i believe in 2012
implementing such a idiotic law that favors women was just a political move to
calm the riots. law should only favor justice not gender."
C24.671,"indian judiciary, government and system , laws all ruined people's life ,not
in rape laws even in day to day life in every area there is local goon which
people used to scare .why it's so? parliament fu*ker who don't make law
properly and especially vote bank politics . favouring a  
law shall not be a solution for stoping crimes . consent mean constent but our
judiciary and parliament so much old buddhaa and buddhi who say rape on the

feminist will not happy and who are dislikes hmmmmm lol?"
C24.676,"this is a incel/mra/red piller propaganda video.  
  
first get justice for the millions of women who are raped every day. those who
are burned. those who are abused. by men. then we can talk about the miniscule
number of false accusations against men.

C24.707,"nice documentary which only showed up when tonnes of lives have already been
destroyed. call me a sexist, misogynist but the history is the bearer of truth
that when power falls into the hands of women/power hungry people, they always
destroy the nations. want an example? look up what indira gandhi did and also
look up the current situation of eu right now. it's simple, men live by logic
and women live by feelings. while i have certainly witnessed exceptions to
this rule, it's generality cannot be argued.  
men have always been the builders and drivers of civilizations, built roads,
buildings railways, transport, drainage systems, working at dangerous
construction sites and other hazardous jobs, going behind enemy lines to fight
wars and many more things.  
but somehow today's world is hellbent on demonizing men and claiming that
women are always good and men are bad. hell even children today are
indoctrinated with this bullshit, as i heard this from my six yr old niece.
there are some mentally crack people which need to be controlled and because
of this, the laws are formulated, implementation of those laws is a separate
topic. it's really important for us to teach our children our essential roles
in today's world that both men and women play, and instill in them sense of
responsibility and habit of pulling their own weight in society. abolish the
social stigma of preferential treatment, and head towards equality like a true
progressive society with your traditional values intact. only then there is
hope for this country."

rape/molestation/ and other form of sexual abuse kiya hoga.  
baaki bache 10% ki shadow mein, faaltu protests kar rahe hain.  
i refuse to believe that all of these ""falsely accused"" ""india's sons"" are
actually purely innocent. additionally, when will we ever talk about the fact
that more often than not, these people get acquitted in the absence of any
physical evidence. get the ipc and study it carefully, falsely promising a
woman that you will marry her and then leaving her after having sex is rape;
forcing her to give consent/get her drunk to obtain consent is rape; even if
she consented (under any circumstances) but feels uncomfortable to go through
with it because of pain or any other factor, yet the boy keeps doing it, that
is rape. there's more than 10 circumstances that will be considered rape, in
the eyes of the law, but no, everything needs to be created at the male's
convenience. most women are of the same view that women are falsely accusing
men now. let it be decided by the judge, what's false, what's not. who are we
to perform a trial? haven't there been cases where an acquittal took place
despite the girl's repeated pleas that she was raped, which of us took a stand
for her? truth is, in this patriarchal society, men give us ""choices"" at men's
convenience to be followed by women for men's satisfaction. and of course,
when just a tiny population of men is actually sensitive and sensible, the
majority being little pieces of shit, it's not uncommon or unusual that even
the innocent (or ""innocent"") ones would get caught in the hurricane."
C24.777,"this is the problem. first we talked of women empowerment and now men
empowerment.

feminism - social movements, and ideologies to achieve the political,

sexes. this means caring about men's, lgbtq and racial issues too. and as a

live in law. a boy and girl, agreed to stay together, with an agreement to
walk out any day. and this agreement is for both the party, but, if men, even
after a mutual concent walks out.. the next day, he will be accused of rape?
how?  
a woman can demand one night stands, with any random guy.. mutual consent,
still, next day, he could be behind the bars, because a drunken sexually
liberated woman's demand and consent , were gone with hang over! why?  
post marriage woman's consent is required, and it's good, for a healthy
marriage. but according to the law, it's the man's duty to satisfy her woman,
whether he wants it or not.. what about men's consent?  
i won't say, not every man is innocent, but, i must say, not every woman is
innocent too..  
# gender equality."
C24.866.4,"@rushali sharma, indian media, indian laws are all against men they all think
negative about men. whenever rape happens both men and women come on roads for
strike, media shouts what is government doing for safety of women. but during
fake rape cases or harassment cases no media supports men nor women supports
men. i have seen many videos and read many comments where indian girls laugh
at men who suffer from fake cases. anyways what girls will do they have to use
the laws somewhere. so called woman empowerment."
C24.868,"many people confuse the word feminism with relating to women.  
feminism is equality.  
no one has the right to destroy anyone's life like that.

and are equally as sinful as real rapists.!"

after dat so many rapist still continues do such actions due support of ur"
C24.869.2,"@shanti joseph doss, god created man and women equally but still there is no
equality between men and women. all the laws are made for women's safety and
it is being misused. innocent men are being punished. when women suffers from
harassment the whole world supports them and when boy suffers nobody supports
them. just like jasleen kaur and saravjit case. when men suffers all girls
talk about equality. reality is girls don't support men and they will never
support men they just do acting that's all."

but there are cases where boys blackmail girls that they say that theyvwill
destroy her if she will even think of moving out from that relation and tell
her to keep suffer in that abusive relationship where they would keep abuses
the girl, beats her, threaten her, blackmail her in the matter of family.  
  
then sometimes a girl had to take this step. because our fucking society will
not believe her and her parents feel ashamed and her life become miserable
because some girls dont born with the fight mechanism in their dna. then
sometimes a girl had to take this step."

a girl having sex with a guy and get married to another guy...no case against

will be filled by the girl.....  
  
so keep your stupid concepts to your self"

ok....lets accept your words for a moment.....  
  
a guy blackmails a girl with her intimate pictures.....then it is also true

why can u justify making a fake rape case connecting this situation????????"

rapist"

i was also accused

C24.949,"our india given too much power to women who can say i been raped by this
person and person is actually innocent he will lose his dignity,his pride what
kind a law is this,fuck this society"
C24.963,"i have severe problem in my spine. inspite of the pain, i have to arch my back
in a painful way a long time, till i get a seat, to prevent any contact with a
women who is standing in front of me and is not even realising she is taking
too much space. because pain is better than risking my life with a false
accusation by woman. infact during peak hours i take a cab inspite of being
expensive, just to be safe. but what will the men who can afford only public
transport do?"
C24.966,"some of the frequent harrassments by women in daily life is in public
transport. our buses and trains hardly have an inch of space during peak
hours, and 2 things annoy me the most about women especially those in their
20s-30s  
young women forcefully occupy the seat reserved for men. they dont even get up
when they see older men. infact some even abuse elder men.  
  
another scary harassment by women starts when a man's body unintentionally
touches or even scrapes a women's dress due to overcroweded buses and trains."
C24.967,"i am going to share this with my women friends too. rape is not a gender
issue, it's a human issue. too many men and women are hating the opposite
gender because there were so many reported rape cases and unreported false
rape accusations. this is highly toxic and avoids looking at the issue
objectively. kudos to the effort. it's not men against women, it is men and
women together to bring light to issues caused by other men and women."

producer : shonee kapoor"
C24.989,"in india fake rapes are very common. u have any issues with a lady and she
shouts molestation. i mean if u are in a bus and ur body touches against
anyone she shouts rape or molestation  
  
  
and thats not an anomaly. in delhi 60% rape cases are fake and in kishanganj
its 96% because people use rape and dowry acts to get revenge or make money.  
  
u break up with ur gf or she wants to breakup with you etc, rape.  
  
worst is, it's a non bailable offence and police messes up charges and without
any evidence you can be thrown into a jail for weeks or months to no hearings
in court.  
  
fake rapes or molestation charges are not as uncommon as people believe  
  
the worst thing with this is, if you are proven innocent the woman just walks
out of the courtroom with no consequences."
C24.1010,"these laws r meant to blackmail & terrorise men. did these laws stopped or
reduce such cases significantly ? answer is simply no !! instead of going to
core of this issue, making draconian laws r only going to ruined social &
family structure. laws r being made only to pacify public anger against govt
without even thinking about it's negative aspect. men r being treated so badly
as if they r aliens or terrorists and women r considered as holly cows who
can't be liers."
C24.1021,"rape culture is the reason for all of this. treat men and women equally from
the beginning. stop shaming the basic human body and treating it as a sexual
object in itself. focus on sex education and destigmatizing sex. prevent rape
at it's source. then there wouldn't be the necessity for such strong laws
against men which are being misused like this!"
C24.1023,"well drafted, gutsy topic. the uglier side is always there.. thanks to potray
it and spread awareness. these kind of cases are much common in punjab and

this issue on a national level. kudos.."
C24.1029,"finally some thing real.. out of other useless topics trending in india. this
one is very necessary !  
this needs to be done... we have come to a point where no men is molested,
used , facing a lot of injustice at many places and from time to time... mens
pride has been raped - a rape that no one can see except the men himself !
this needs to be change... the real feminism needs to get introduce to woman !"
C24.1036.1,"yes worldwide women misuse their gender, their beauty and charm to manipulate
men. if that also doesn't work, they open up their bra, show off their
cleavage and make moves to attract men into submission. this is a bitter truth

that all women are liars... but many are... men have no choice... its like

raped and destroying a man's life just like that . i feel like addressing them
like "" do you even realize the gravity of what you're saying ? it's not a
fucking playground bullying where you can casually say someone pushed you .
rape is not a scratch on skin that you can just use it when you want revenge'
. such women not only destroy every life that is associated with theirs but
they undermine the seriousness and terrible nature of rape itself. these women
undermine and disrespect the actual victims . shame on them."

my soul is crushed under such burden, i don't know how long im gonna survive

comparable to this trifling (small) number of cases. women are afraid to speak
up far more often than men. furthermore, saying ""i was raped"" is likely to get
women abused by their society.  
  
i will admit that these cases exist. but if you were to change the law for
these 1 in a thousand cases, those 1000 women would never speak up. laws are
far better if they tackle those 1000 problems and help those 1000 women by
having really strict laws on men compared to helping that 1 man by requiring
proof from every woman (who will not be able to provide proof). this is the
unfortunate reality, but it chooses the lesser evil."

yes, men can be and are victims of sexual abuse, harrassment or rape too.. and
not necessarily at the hands of a woman. add false accusation to that list and
this is something that everyone needs to be aware of. just like a woman who
was a victim of a sex crime, men who are falsely accused go through hell too.
it amazes me that some women can get so low and falsely accuse someone of a
sex crime when there are so many actual victims fighting a losing battle. and
just like a lot of actual rapists or abusers, these women seem to get away
with what they did to ruin an innocent man's life.

8 year old girl rape case and uttarpradesh unnao rape case, these are very
recent rape cases and your showing man feeling shamed and injured by police
mistreat are problem with women. relationship breakup after sex may have false

complaining about rape to her parents or husbands then it's her fault and if
the parents or husbands are not believing rape then they are not real parents
or husband . if society is the problem teach to the society. if women were
treated badly by their family members then they are not true family members.
it's their problem . nice logic. only 45% ? you say 'only 45'? just because
it's 10 percent less, it is a minority for you. i stated delhi because delhi
is the state which has seen brutal rape cases and awareness for rape is high
there in the capital and this is wrongly used by fake feminists and females to
revenge men. this is become a bad example. if you really care you should be
against those fake women who bring the seriousness of rape down with fake
complaints . these fake females and feminists are an insult to the suffering
of true rape victims like nirbhaya"

what happens to the life of a man who has been falsely accused ? he loses his
job, his friends and society will look at him differently, etc. just search
about saravjeet singh and jasleen kaur case in youtube. you will know. after
nirbhaya rape case there has been these fake women who has been using the laws
to take revenge on men. nearly 45% rape cases were false in delhi. you talk
about feminism which is gender equality, minority rights, etc. but when men
are punished you say that they are just minorities and we shouldn't care about
these innocent men"

people,police,law till you are proven innocent and in that time your your
professional,social life will be doomed.the law needs to be changed."
C24.1326,"so inspiring even i feel the same about men that they should be given equal
respect the way we are fighting for women , they(men's) always have been taken
for granted , with great responsibilities great joy and happiness comes but
when we talk about men they don't get such privileges , girls are always
fostered and nutured a lot by there family but same doesn't not happens with
men !  
feels good that you people have come up with such a content !  
even during [#metoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo)
movement there were numerous women's who filed fake cases to gain sympathy out
of it !  
shame on them ,not because they're women. but humans !"
C24.1334,"teach not only boys but also ur girls how to behave, not all boys are rapist
and not all girls are innocent. respect human not gender."
C24.1336,"especially needed in a country where there exists a law called ""rape on
promise of marriage"", which is a completely unnecessary and hateful law which
destroys the lives of (a bare minimum of) several thousand indian men forever,
each year.  
  
for those who dont know, the aforementioned law  
1) calls it ""rape"" when men break a promise of marriage when it can be
demonstrated that sex was based on that promise.  
2) it is extremely easy to get men locked up for weeks or sometimes even
months after an arrest made before any investigation, solely based on the
woman's word; even if the breach of promise was made later due to some other
reason, and sometimes when there was no promise at all.

C24.1347,"i can't express my gratitude towards this..as i always think y not men to be
hanged till death jn these cases but the reality makes me feel ashamed of
other women who made it or use it for fun...laws never meant to make fun these
r to be enjoyed with their true values and meaning..."
C24.1354.1,"@navya patil you are talking about whom then you are referring to men or
women. you are talking about human beings then who are human beings there are
two genders in human beings male and female like that in other species too. if
any person keep false allegations on a person who is innocent that person
becomes the enemy of the humanity.  
look. according to me there are two genders males and females that's it i
don't give a damn about third gender. i am anti lgbt person who will oppose
them because i feel they are huge threat to humanity all women and men will
suffer if they get corrupted.  
according to me feminist is about the rights of girls that it not about men at
all. all i care about humanity,nature,wildlife and animals that's it. always
fighting for equality for education is fine,jobs fine if you have potential to
take care of the pressure no problem go ahead, but if you don't want to change
initial after marriage that is not acceptable you should always be called of
your husband name or his initial which i don't agree if anyone oppose that  
asking for father share of property ok no problem. but if men can marry
multiple women doesn't mean women can marry i will always be against the idea
. fighting for rights in everything is not acceptable. equality in good things
is ok i have full support but not in bad things also. always don't imitate men
for everything. few things ok. always crying over men that women are not
getting justice saying this is wrong.  
if you have potential to take care of both career and family equally then no
problem go ahead. if you are not able to balance both then forget about job.
just take care of children because children can be raise properly by women
more than men. if you want to get divorce though your husband not done
anything wrong then forget about asking money from him. if you are earning
money good then you have no right to ask money from your husband if you are
getting divorced.  
i am not feminist at all i agree women should fight for equality for few
things not everything. if men can do why can't we do. now men are drinking and
smoking try to stop them and don't become like them. if men are bribing try to
stop them don't do the same thing. if men are going for casino try to stop
them not do the same thing. if men are using drugs stop them not doing the
same thing etc."

i do either. what i do understand is that you've stirred up quite a bit of
tension due to your miscommunication.  
  
secondly.......oh, spunky guy's statement does not seem just to you? well,
it's the truth. indian law has become very lopsided since nirbhaya. be it a

punch me i will punch back don't care if its man or woman that is equality"
C24.1404,"people seem to forget that in spite of such laws, crimes against women
continue. a person who misuses a law is a criminal and should be treated as

objectivity. i would hate to see this as another piece that eventually becomes
detrimental to women."
C24.1435,"feminism is not misusing the law. the real feminists are those who are doing

are ruined."

laugh at them, women are afraid men will kill them). fucking bullshit. have
fun with your small dicks and remaining virgins until mommy and daddy find you

like 90: 10 ratio...most of the cases are true and the criminals have not been

genuine cases called for drastic measures. there should be charges against

be after and not taking sides."

makers should burn there.  
all i can see in this video is lack of policing and numerous amount of human
rights violations.  
if somebody lodge a complaint against someone does it mean he/she is guilty ?
isn't that the police should investigate crime first and then make arrest or
in this case even if police make arrest first isn't it is part of job to
investigate later in proper manner ?  
complaint is false or right in any case there should be proper investigation

harassed. it's an endemic problem in the jails, in army, even in colleges and
universities. there are things done to young boys in the name of ragging or
hazing that if it happened to any girl, you'd immediately say it's sexual
assault. it leads to lifelong trauma, depression, even suicide for the
victims. there needs to be a reappraisal of sexual mores in this country of
how men are also victimized, not only through fraudulent allegations but many,
far more than are being reported, are rape survivors themselves."

codes. the draconian laws of ipc section 493, ipc section 495, ipc section 313

false sexual harrasment accusations.  
  
police detains men just based on accusations with no evidence and only
releases until proven innocent.  
  
police does not detain women until they are proven guilty, and continue with
them without any evidence.  
  
plus the golddigger women who want to divorce after a short period of time and
steal 50% of ex-husband's property and money through an alimony.  
  
honeytrapping and extorting money from men in a threat of filing a false
complaint  
  
shut up your ""rape, rape claims""  
all bullshit has been debunked.  
  
if such things continue to exist in such a ""democracy"" then democracy has to
be one of the shittiest systems. no surprise india and usass have the same
problems. a stupid system of no good use.  
  
and what happens is those who actually get raped don't get any justice and
those who were never raped misuse the laws.  
  
democrazy is a shitty system , both india and usass are infected with it, and
the supreme court judges in those respective countries purposely create biased
bills to fit their masonic agenda.  
  
to say accurately, to your ""rape"" thing, india is actually booming with

feminism is about equality. but there is no woman in india who will call for
protest against alimony, child support, child custody, divorce due to
impotence, 498a even biased definition of rape in ipc.  
in india, feminism is like sc, st, obc reservation quota. these feminist woman
uses it to get unfair advantages, whereas, the village girls, who actually
need equality probably never heard of the term ""feminism"".

away, now since i stay alone, i don't worry roaming around in the naked, i was
having my shower and she stood there watching me, the moment i noticed , she
acted as if she accidentally saw it. this was so uncomfortable !!!!  
  
next, i began noticing my underwear being stolen , never had this issue ever.  
  
then this girl began spamming me wierd messages which got me pissed. then she
left back for new delhi, she would video call me late at night in very
revealing outfits and i didn't quite like it. but i never had anything in my
mind so, i ignored it.  
  
the she began repeated visits all the way from new delhi to my neighbours (her
uncle) every fucking weekend , and would simply enter my house.  
  
one day, i was having sex with my new date (a man) , thankfully, i kept the
bedroom locked and this girl knocked it and stood out until i opened it , it
was so displeasing, that we had to dress up fast and act as if we were
drinking and having a good male time together. only to open the door and see
her completely naked ,right in front of my bedroom with me and my male
companion looking in utter shock. she didn't expect another male in the house
since i was the lonely tenant. i realised this girl is a weirdo and i began
locking my doors, would sleep at one of my hookup friends or mates or just
anyone else's house at night on weekends because she would come to visit me,
changed my number, everything.  
  
one fine day, she dropped in with her cousins and began shouting at me at my
house by collecting everyone, and my father visited me all the way from surat
, gujarat that morning, she kept saying everyone that i tricked her and had
sex under the context of relationship and showed screenshots of me on my
whatsapp messenger videos, what's even more surprising is that she took
pictures of me while i was in shower oneday in the naked, she showed our
lengthy conversations at night etc. she found my new number from someone in my
office by visiting and stalking me and sent me threatening messages of
alleging molestation and rape charges against her.  
  
i was so shocked and almost about to cry that i was being a friend to her as
she was in a horrible marriage and having divorce with her now husband
already, and that he used to beat her up and all that.  
  
i decided that's it's enough and i made my mind that i won't take this
atrocious behaviour towards me since my elder brother was himself a victim of
""false rape charges"" against him , i collected the entire world including my
relatives my office mates, my friends all over the digital world, the society
members, and guess what ? **i came out as a gay man because i had no choice**  
  
i opened up about my sexuality and everything to everyone including my parents
, my brothers, my boss, my teachers , everyone !  
i was not going to take this woman's shit anymore.  
  
i showed all my sex chats to the world with all the men i had it with, called
all the guys whom i hooked up with, showed all my pictures of me being gay
ever since i realised my sexuality at age 14 and the bullying i suffered as a
child. i didn't stop there ! i called up my ex and asked him to show the
videos were we kissed, had cosy consented adult time together, showed proofs
of gay bar visits in us , finland, israel and all places that i visited.  
  
and asked her if she wanted to really marry me if i keep having sex with men
and be her husband at the same time, she was even more shocked than she could
ever even dream of !  
  
gay men (90% of the time) are masculine and you would never even know that
they're gay until they say it themselves. most indian gay men by age 35 ,
almost 99% marry women to hide their sexuality. i'm of the remainder 1% who
are proud of themselves.  
  
found out this woman had a child already 5 years younger to me , already.  
  
lesson learnt :  
never even befriend a girl or be her companion in her bad times, you might end
up being called a rapist. lol, i can't even imagine seeing a woman nude , let
alone touching her , i literally keep a hand on the part in the porn where
naked girls are around hot naked men to avoid any visual encounter.  
  
my heart beats out for all my heterosexual brothers who have faced such female
molestation or rape charges, even worse if they ever consensual sex , because
the man is screwed now for life ! i saved myself because i was gay , ya'll
have no hopes !  
i also feel bad for girls who have been victims of rape by men, i won't be
biased at all. women do face more of sexual assaults than us men do, no point
in denial but there are many a times , men are victims of it themselves.  
  
imagine. showing your relatives, your sex videos with other people to prove
your sexuality just **so that nobody calls me a rapist**  
i knew those charges would be useless but once an allegation always is a
charge especially if it's a male. ""woh dekho wo launde ko, shadi shuda aurat
ka rape kiya usne""  
nobody would believe me even if i were to be free from all that legally. took
quick action, saved my family from all that shame .  
  
i'm not ashamed of being a gay man, because i made my life out being called a
chakka, hijda, what not by my own brothers, nobody accepted me not even my
straight bestfriend as i grew up because i trusted them and they ditched me ,
as a result i began engulfing my own self either by suffering it or having sex
with other men who would comfort me or play with me for some days in my
teenage years and support me emotionally and cry lonely in the showers and
beat myself ,cursing being a unlucky shame to the family. while my brothers
who did nothing significant didn't have to prove themselves just because
they're straight.  
  
many of my relatives distanced me since we are a conservative family what
matters is my own family, took no shame of me. my employers know my hardwork,
my friends know my value, my neighbours know my support.  
found immense respect socially. actually ,even more after coming out.  
  
my prayers with all rape victims of whatever gender, even more with the gay
men because nobody even reports it if it has been done out of society. most of
teenage gay men are sexually assaulted by their own heterosexual cousins or
had some encounter. you have no idea the trauma gay men suffer as children
being excluded from the world. drying within, most marry women by adulthood
just so that their parents have their dreams fulfilled , drinking their own
self sacrifice of being at freewill as venom. don't blame them, blame each and
every indian citizen for that.  
imagine being a victim , where court deemed us as criminals, religions
admonished us, families throwing us out, brothers beating us, our mothers love
us but they have no choice .  
  
god bless you if you've read this far. i'm just like your brother, son, begin
accepting us for who we are , this will save a lot of devastation from your
own human fellow being."
C24.2217,"just amazing. best regards to the director and his team.  
yes some girls are falsely accusing and misusing their power by asking about
equality. we are equal from the beginning itself. a female don't really knew
what feminism is but misuse her power by using it. in some places metros are
free for girls, there are girl's night in pub. but why? can't we pay the bills
or we are so weak? a female is making a female weak by pointing out the words
like ""freedom"" and ""equality"". recently what happened in noida? if that
happened to a girl, people would have come out and start protesting for
freedom and justice. but those were boys so no one came further for their
justice.  
what i'm saying is gender equality.  
we are already equal, if such things goes on and on there will be an another
movement, which will be named as ""mascularism"" and of course india will be the
first to start such kind of movement.  
everyone is equal and should be. if something is doing wrong, he or she should
be punished equally. everyone have their own voice and power. misusing these
powers will not help anyway or the other. rather it will ruined someone else's
life."

actually go really mad. it really triggers. the internet is completely filled
with people who has blamed feminism for everything. it comes to a point where
your brain gets triggered when you see comments like this.  
the other side is that the people who blame feminism end up not listening but
they turn the same comment into different story by narrating it to their

it's not a joke playing a victim."
C24.2421,"and india fights for patriarchy. we need to understand that crime against any
individual is a serious issue and i too feel bad for the victims but at the
same time we need to address the fact that crime against a woman is even more
grave. there are so many social perks which men enjoy just because they are
men and a woman in this country cannot even raise voice against someone to
protect her modesty. all kinds of social barriers are applied on her. the
documentary seems to be completely biased for sure. if compared the ratio of
crime done against men and women , women stands in majority. i am surprised
that how callously this fact has been ignored. pity and shame !! the only
solution i feel to this is that :  
  
a : india should stop calling itself a liberal country. it's not !  
  
b : separate school, colleges, hospitals, transportation for men and women. so
there's least interaction.  
  
c : make different compartments for men and women in any public place, office
building and different hrs for the two.

them, they are diminished with proper education about how to give consent to
sex and how to treat women (and people in general) with respect. this is where
india is lacking. how many times have i heard indian men say: well she asked
for being cat called for the way she dressses or she acts western or dresses
western or she goes outside late in the evening so mera haq hain. how tf is
that logical thinking, work on that messed up mind set first before going on
the street marching for mens rights. and why would women jeopordize their

happen more in the low educated regions of the country. all of us need healthy
individual boundaries and communication of those boundaries. even men need

like you. you would rather show solidarity with people of similar gender than
with people of similar mentality sadly. men's reluctance to participate in
metoo is strangely self sabotaging. the fact that even a tweet is getting
attention is indeed a positive development . statistically speaking a
declaration only gets traction when there are already substantial numer of
previously occurring instances to validate it. crime against women is so

rape is a heinous crime & should be dealt with utmost care and respect for
women, while on the other hand those alleging false allegations against a
person of rape should be punished equally as a person being punished for rape.  
in the name of equality and women empowerment, the society has confused itself
with feminism. a equal society is acceptable, but a feminist society is at all
not. this is the reason why rapes are increasing though there are strict laws
against it in the country.  
when a man slaps a women, he is a criminal and when a girl slaps a man she is

2)as mentioned in one incident that when an affair is revealed women make
false rape charges to protect themselves.such actions are absolutely wrong but
the reason behind it is that our society does not accept women who are in a
sexual relationship before marriage. it's an easy go for men though (""hate
comments coming my way for this statement"")  
3) people in general don't understand the line between feminism and equality.  
wrong whether done by men or women should be treated equally in terms of
punishment. whether it is as heinous as false rape accusations or breaking
traffic rules. ye logon ko bilkul samajh nahi aata  
4) and lastly the problem of inequality is severe in villages and small towns
were girls and women are not much educated. the condition is really poor
their. so please don't think that false allegations thing is common all over

i guess the only answer here is that the laws should be really strict, things
shouldn't be done emotionally but mentally and logically by having proper
investigation, and most importantly, government should invest more on street
cameras. there should be a working camera in each and every single street, and

men should support girls when in danger... similarly all women should support
when men are in danger.. there should be no ego of gender as there should be
no issue of gender either.. i myself have faced this fake feminism but also
saw my friend (girl) being harassed by some big boys by continuous blowing of
horns of jeep and following her... please support girls and boys... and girls
should support boys who know that there are being accused wrongly and boys
should support girls.... and fight those evils... girls should be totally
against those evil girls who are degrading your feminism movement and using it
in wrong way... and boys should be totally against those evils harassing the

changed things n out thinking fr opposite gender. did they forget 1-2

caged in houses, no equality, no rights of education, child marrriages n
several more senseless prathaas n rivaajis. who changed it??????? did they
fight it out alone, did they make freedom n equality alone by themselves no
not at all, we only put strenght n courage in them, fought with them n taught
them to fight for their right n all they forgot??? were we wrong???? n so many
facilities many girls in lakhs in india did nt get it before n now what all
equalities n rights n freedom they get. nt fr sitting n pissing on our head.

drugs alcohol, make a big chutia out of their parents by lying constantly fr
doing things n going to places they cant tell to their parents , they r only
on fire to try n do new n different things but anything happens blame the
boys, for very wrong they do that also blame the boys, they do mitake bt make
tamashaa show tears n gain sympathy n consideration n support frm people

of doctor played by the actor, then its his personal personality, it doesn't
have to do with heroism or patriotism or feminist or misogyny or anything!! a
character (not hero, which is low grade though of indian people that films
have a hero) a protagonist is does not mean a hero.. thats a childish
consideration , heroes are in marvel or either soldiers. these films only has
actors!! so an actor can be of any fucking kind, a drug addict, a womanizer, a
smoker a boxer a playboy.. any fucking thing.. there is no any thumb rule that
the protagonist has to be only the rahul or raj from ddlj, by the way raj was
a womanizer too! but that didn't bother these low life bitches.. and if they
say films promote misogyny, and preaches bad stuff and people become like
that, then god save the world from these dumb bitches and rajeev masand... in

2\. when swara was fucking vibrating herself then you hypocrites were fucking
applauding and the same scene where kabir singh puts ice in his pants that is
toxic masculinity to you  
  
  
3\. now reverese the fucking scene where he slapped her ! if preti slapped him
, you guys would have been applauding ki sahee kiya ! just because a man
slapped a woman so that apprently makes him a bad human being ! even if she
cheats on her partner. you know woman ! this is the fucking problem , when we
say ! "" ladkiya kadam sey kadam chal rai hai mardo k "" its you guys who brings
in this this fucked up biased feminine shit that makes woman categorised in
the weaker section of the society. if you dont are the weaker gender anymore -
"" why do you fucking need a coach in metros"" "" why is there a relaxation of
cut offs for girls in colleges"" "" why is that you guys need seats in buses""
coz you people want woman to be weak so that you guys can enjoy the luxory of
the rights a woman has in this society.  
  
  
4\. when preeti tells kabir to kiss him in college - you guys dint have a
probelm there and or you guys dint fucking reprimanded her character why not ?
i ll tell you why - coz this time "" a man was saying no"" so i guess it dint
pass your peanut sized brain that ya even that should be reprimanded.  
  
  
5\. and the scene where he a""allegedly"" tried to rape that woman over a knife
point - first of all it was mutual she called him she was cheating on her
fiance - nobody wants to fucking highlight that right coz as a woman you can
do whatever the fuck you want to right ?!  
  
  
all in all please broaden your mind. i hope someone reads this . when a woman
slaps a man its always assumed that the man must have done something wrong and
if a man slaps a woman then oh my god how can he do tht !!! grow up fuck face
! and all you feminists out there - stop trying to make a woman feel that they
are weak ! if you have balls to say woman are the same as men ! stop fucking
being a bunch of hypocritical fucks and try to prove deliberetly that they are
weak ! its become a joke these days ! fucking feminists !

but u know what? those women (talking about those innocent women, who gets
beaten up more often by their husbands) who are under torture , mental stress
because of the men whom they are married to, will never accept this type
mentality projected in this film.  
  
the reason why so many girls of morden india are liking it is because they
were never under this kind of pressure or torture from a drunken man, they
were raised in decent environments..that’s it, accept it or not that’s the

C8.2454,"i think people in the comment section are missing the point here. it’s not
about showing a character like arjun reddy, but about the subtext behind the
story. the subtext tries to make a “hero” without identifying the abuse he is
doing. let’s look at an example here. sardar khan in gangs of wasseypur forces
himself on nagma, and nagma falls in love too with him. same foreground, but
let’s look at the subtext. sardar khan has been portrayed as this dark twisted
character by the director. he’s still a likable character but the director
never shies away from discussing his dark behavior as it is. the subtext is
aware of his wrong doings and that’s why it’s okay. now, no one is asking
filmmakers to be overt feminists like kashyap is. i mean nagma does use sardar
for sex, and does start a family with him, for her character has been shown to
be attracted to this abusive guy in the society filled with similar folks. she
decides to marry him and get some leverage in the society. it’s her decision
that the audience can study. rather, kashyap later goes in develop her as this
badass woman who gets sardar killed when she gets wronged. a sudden
development of a strong female character without breaking realism. arjun reddy
is distasteful in 2017-19 era. films like these were a norm till the last
decade. it’s just sad to see people gravitating towards such regressive
thoughts. this conversation also takes me back to javed akhtar’s fantastic
argument breaker. he says don’t get into why the film is bad. but ask people,
if there was no abuse in his actions against women as such, then what was it
that made millions of men get titilated by it. javed used this argument for
pragya thakur’s nomination. he said people are saying pragya doesn’t have
those cases proven against her. to that javed said you ask those people, if
she didn’t do those things, then why is liked. it’s because you think she did
that against the muslims she is famous. or else why is she a hit. a kind of a
twisted analogy, but try to understand it. arjun reddy type films should have
become obsolete, but ....well."

stands for herself all while kabir loses everything because of his violent,
psychopathic tendencies, it would have surely worked.

sympathetic background score plays because the typical indian audience is so
dumb that they change their attitude towards a scene simply because the
background score tells them to do so. this is the problem with the
movie...there is nothing wrong with a man like kabir as your central character

C8.10920,"movies are either engaging or they are not. that’s what makes them work or
not. as for toxic masculinity - 1. shahid has made a very bad choice & suffers
endlessly till he gives up in the extreme end & makes a change.
transformational characters have a way of connecting with audiences, come what
may. 2. let’s look at patriarchy narrative - all love stories true or untrue
have that. there’s also reverse discrimination against men in society at times
- biggest example all supposed criminals guilty of crime yet to be proved are
published with photos n names if you are a male. go look for traffic challans
- less than 5% number is female - ain’t that surprising ? all power to women -
watch bhavani bhavai, mirch masala, rudaali n many more. 3. let’s look at
patriarchy & other stupid evils as in movies - all karva chauth scenes ever,
lavish weddings n songs, success at any cost, all super fit heroes & heroines,
the list is endless. these are subliminal & vicious more damaging than
anything. 4. flawed characters are just that - characters in a story arc. we
have flawed protagonists in darr, baazigar, anjaam, devdas, dev d, raging
bull, taxi driver, wolf of wall street, a clockwork orange, so many more. it’s
just a movie. 5. do haunted houses shown means we never buy them or that
ghosts exist ? there’s free will & free choice. 6. what’s bigger cheating -
saying that you are catering to family & make movies like race3, thugs of
hindustan, zero, kalank, tubelight & cheat audience of non engaging bullshit.
or dada kondke, mithun movies which know their audience - engaged or
entertained them, though not to everyone’ s taste. but they were not cheating
their audience. 7. an actor becomes a muslim to marry 2nd time, so many actors
have extramarital affairs, so many actresses break homes & marry a married
person. nepotism, corruption is always okay when it’s personal but not in
public domain. should we be boycotting all these to set an example ? 8. i felt
disappointed when laila majnu, sonchidiya flopped & bodyguard, raja hindustani
etc. made money. in terms of technicalities & acting skills kabir singh is
good, trying a narrative which is engaging at times & cringy at others. this
will work overall for sure. why look for political correctness all the time ?

C8.11423.2,"​@elva136 see, it is just my personal opinion , but it would be better if you
do not use the over-used words such as 'feminist', 'male entitlement', and
'toxic' when you argue against this movie(or the mentality that has become
this movie).  
  
  
the reason is that there is so much of bullshit that is attached with the
definition of these words, most of it coming from the privileged but dumb
american left and most of the issues that are raised using those words are
concerning only the educated financially independent upper middle class white
women. in india, where there are communities and citizens that have only
slowly started to understand that women are also human beings and not just
properties, we are eons and eons behind the west in the basic understanding of
human rights. so when you appropriate such academic words to the indian
context, there would be a huge distortion in the message you want to convey,
not to mention the meaning lost due to cultural differences. where in the west
their first world issue is to have the right to be topless in public, in india
the public have yet to acknowledge the basic right of a woman to choose what
she wants to wear.  
  
  
furthermore, these words have been parrotted within and without context so
often, that it could mean just about anything but basic right of a woman for
respect, dignity and freedom in the society, especially in a country like
india, where there are women that belong to a wide variety of economic
classes, not to mention segregations based on caste.  
  
  
what i have also observed is that the conservatives of india have also started
to appropriate the words and arguments of the western conservatives, like
'libtards', to nullify such criticisms as against kabir singh. which they
would do easily, because what they are basically nullifying is the dumb
arguments of american left appropriated by the indian liberals. the american
left liberals are nowhere near as rational or educated as indian liberals,
leftists and centrists, while the american conservatives are far more
progressive when compared to the indian conservatives( who are just a bunch of
undemocratic dumb savages).  
  
  
instead of directly using those words in the arguments, arguing using the
rationale behind those words, while keeping in mind the reality of how deep
such discriminations are etched in the fabric of our indian society, would do
more more good, i guess. not for the sake of winning the argument, nor in the
hope that these dumb idiots would understand it somehow. but for the rational
people who still has a flicker of humanity in them, to read such arguments and
spread the message."
C8.12427,"**okay first of all. fuck your feminism and keep it aside. secondly have you
ever been in an relationship? things like fights, ego coming in between,
insulting each other in anger etc, etc is common. they 've just showed the
reality. and btw the thing you said about that fat chick and beautiful chick
wala thing... its the reality that such friendship lasts longer comparing to
two fit girls. men/guys do such shits like having alcohol, smoke etc etc after
breakups and we're living in a generation where not all but some girls/women
to start having these things so the point is they showed what are the things
which actually happens in an relationship. don't go in her reviews guy's kabir
singh is an entertaining movie. and aunty just take it as a movie for
entertainment purpose. why the fuck you're taking it a whole next level?**"

is best for you. according to you in a film the heroine is a girl, and the
hero should also be a girl. kyaa karega oo bechara director bahennn!!! tu hi
baata de.. puri film mein ladki ko sir pe utha k chalega.?.. that will not be
a movie.. only the feminists like you will go and watch these movies... come
on.. thats the reality of college life. and in this movie kabir singh is not
promoting drugs chutiyaaa... he is showing that he is a drug addict and he is
suffering for it. now in india most of the college students smokes and drinks.
and it is a reality based movie. not a movie like race 3... tu jisko kidnap
bol rahi hai naa.. hamare yaha usko hang out bolte hai.. because it is with
the girls concurrence. you are talking about the scene where sahid slaps
kiara... toooo woo jo 7-8 slaps kiara ne sahid ko maari.. uske bare mein kyaaa
batayegi tuu!!!! is it woman empowerment? according to you a girls family
member can say anything to the boy but the boy should stand and listen
everything, and whene it is done he should go home without reacting.

does it , and all that you say that"" she suffered "" in college , she never
said 'no' or showed any kind of uninterested behavior , when kabir slept on
her lap she called her freinds to bring blanket , dont you fucking understand
that no one was ""suffering"" , just like any other fake feminist you are here
to spill bullshit ,. i am not saying all feminist are fake , there are real
feminists but she is , dont go around and spoil the excitement of other people
on a good movie , and you were behaving as if kabir raped her whereas as soon
as he realised what he was doing he left , fuck off now"

fucking feminine mentality ...chill it's a movie it's not promoting anything..
den flims based on murder is promoting murder ? and for ur kind information
she isn't kidnapped she went by her own choice and charges of molestation u
are putting on the character is not a legit one ..the lady herself wanted to
get intimate coz her husband is not able to satisfy her enough.. are you
fucking kidding me? sorry u misinterpreted the whole flim and  
talking bullshit 🤣😂 now directors have to keep in mind and glorify the female
protagonist 😂 to satisfy the feminists coz glorifying males is something
trivial to the feminists like you"
C8.14130,"the speciality or the difference the movie holds is just to show the extreme
nature a human being can induce due to the wrong deisions he takes almost all
the times ,hence this is what is interesting to see whether a person like this
can actually repent his extreme nature and rectify his own life .that is what
makes it more of watchable and the gets the curiosity in
[it.now](http://it.now/) as u say its a far from reality atmosphere is being
created and thats how movies are made ,nobody wants to see the actual routine
life or a flawless protagonist ,cause thats how boring all are lifes are and
to keep the audience thinking we do need some thing out of the normal to be
showcased ."
C8.14399,"arjun reddy is much better than kabir singh. those who watched arjun reddy
will relate, kabir singh is not a to z copy of arjun reddy, its a to v
probably. dr are many scenes in original movies which was best, & changed in
remake. like in kabir singh ,kabir takes preeti to boys hostel (awkward) and
dry her clothes in balcony but in original he takes her to different
house,take care of her and puts her clothes to dry at back of the house and
tells his frd not to go dt side as he kept preeti clothes to dry unlike in
original he keeps the clothes to dry in balcony in boys hostel👎 . and after
meeting his father when kabir leaves and preeti tries to stop him,he say to
preeti who are you? "" tumhay koun janta hai ,tu sirf kabir ki bandi hai"" was
so degrading to watch . and many other scene was remade and changed
unnecessarily making it worst. director should have changed other scene like
slapping her, kissing her without her consent,body shaming etc.. atleast arjun
reddy was better and vijay performance was soo good."
C8.15006,"1\. firstly he didn't approach the lady without her permission in the first
half. she was a lady who cheats on her husband.  
2\. he didn't beat any men without any cause. guys who r cheating in the  
game and guy who molested his gf received his beatings and a good class from
him.  
  
3\. he's not as perfect as u r madam. plz forgive him after all he is just a
drunkard who values a life even he was fully drunk and unable to get up but
attends the operation and saves the life.  
finally he realises his mistakes and becomes a clean man.  
we must accept the fact that no one is perfect.  
the main point is whether he realised what is wrong and what is right or not.
thats it.

prejudices."

C40.18,"and now, a real dessert coming up for you straight from god from the bible.
(romans 1 - new international version) ...... ""for since the creation of the
world god’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been
clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are
without excuse.  
  
21 for although they knew god, they neither glorified him as god nor gave
thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were
darkened. 22 although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and
exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images made to look like a mortal
human being and birds and animals and reptiles.  
  
24 therefore god gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to
sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 they
exchanged the truth about god for a lie, and worshiped and served created
things rather than the creator—who is forever praised. amen.  
  
26 because of this, god gave them over to shameful lusts. even their women
exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 in the same way the
men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust
for one another. men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in
themselves the due penalty for their error. furthermore, just as they did not
think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of god, so god gave them over to a
depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. although they know
god’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not
only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice
them."" .... and this one, you can put wherever you want ....... who said that,

C40.36,"but homophobia is there in society and by making this topic known to more
people and tell them it's absolutely normal we can reduce homophobia to a
certain extent so we should talk about these topics. why? bcz no one till now
talked abt this that's why these topics are taboo in our society. and we need
to understand the need of not discriminating people based on their sexual
preferences. i think sadgurus answer was diplomatic."
C40.37,"sounds like liberals funded this clown. the only reasons our bodies develop
sexual desires and impulses is to create life!! the pleasure is secondary. but
if you grow up in a society where sexuality is sensationalized and overly
exposed. you going to think it's for pleasure solely and creating life is a
after thought.. but homosexuality omits ""creating"" all together"
C40.46,"everybody should know that homosexuality is in our regional.. hindusim is only
culture who shows homosexuality... its natural...... love ,accept youself..
that more important rather than somebody accept you 🌈🌈🌈💖💞💖love is
love🌈🌈🌈🌈👫👭👬🌈🌈"
C40.47.1,"because homosexuality has always been a natural and normal aspect of human
sexuality. then there are all of the levels of bisexuality."
C40.52,"what promotion?  
giving people safe space to accept themselves as who they are is promotion?  
telling lgbt kids that they dont deserve to go suicidal is promotion?  
perhaps that makes sense, but as long as the world promotes heterosexual acts
on social media, tv, bollywood, we have no other alternative.  
thats not promotion! if straight people wouldnt be showing romance on daily
soaps, we lgbt wouldnt be asking for that either.  
and taking off the shame that has been for many lgbt people by marching for
parade and creating more awareness isnt promotion. in that way, all religious
festivals and political rallies and even protests for social changes are
unnecessary promotions too."
C40.59.3,"becoz he is straight ...so its hard for him to understand to understand
homosexuality...but its everyone personal prefrences so we dont need to
discuss it thats what he wanted to say...which is similar to
me...homosexuality is out of my understanding but i respect others choices..."
C40.81,"homosexuality is a stimulating choice,lack of motivation.a man born as man
could become a man leaving all the transgender thoughts by motivating
himself,here motivation play a crucial role for every person to become who he
should be.a man if known about growing muscles,become a soldier or become best
son to his parent snever get thoughts becoming lgbt etc.."
C40.83,"what does he mean by ""promote"" homosexuality? it's not something that one is
out of choice and some kind of social influence. no amount of ""promotion"" can
make a heterosexual a homosexual and vice versa. people just are what they
are."
C40.87,"he is awesome...it doesn't require promotion it is natural like any
heterosexual life so why should we segregate that and promote it as if it is
something to be told. if we have to change people's minds there is a whole set
of issues like caste religion which also includes sexuality which people do
not accept and stand by their views. until and unless no one harm others
mentally or physically no need for any lectures or opinions"
C40.116.1,"let me explain what he said. religion has nothing to do with sexuality. it's a
discipline that helps people keep harmony in their lives and accept others.
and religion says about love only that's pure without any expectations. as
long as love is love and pure is not a sin but when it becomes lust there's
suffering whether it's between heterosexual or homosexual couples. and as long
as freedom is all about own satisfaction or happiness (whether a sin or not)
and doesn't harm others , it's acceptable but beyond that there is rules and
law against it."
C40.131,"it's just sad that we have come to a point where homosexuals cannot avail
their fundamental rights without glorifying or promoting themselves. it is not
the fault of homosexuals that their activities end up being glorification. had
homosexuality been accepted and considered as normal by everyone, this would
never have happened. to be fair, this is the case with most other oppressed
communities be it women or dalits. all i want to say is that inorder for the
lgbt people to be accepted and integrated into the society, some degree of
desensitization and promotion is necessary. otherwise, even this historic
judgement would not have been possible."
C40.150,"heterosexuality doesnt get promoted therefore homosexuality doesnt need to get
promoted too. promoting it discriminates it in a way. we all should just
normalize it and be unbothered about it."

that's why she hates man and become lesbian and that gay is saying i become
gay because of lady gaga it mean he was raped by women"
C41.92,"homosexuality is a disorder, created by a warped cognition.  
  
humans evolved with specific emotions and organs with a goal in mind. for
instance, males developed penises for reproduction. how does nature encourage
one to reproduce? sexual attraction. how does nature encourage one to
reproduce again after already done so? sexual pleasure that releases dopamine
that happens after release of sperm or female orgasm.  
  
other forms of love exist just to develop social bonds which creates a herd
group since humans are social animals. males and females were not meant to
have sex with the same sex. friendship? yes. sex in the butt or fingering? no.  
  
homosexuals that still have vaginas and penises are going against their
natural evolution and experience feelings that are abnormal in how nature
intended. biology isn't perfect (yes, psychology is biology with behaviorism).  
  
it's a disorder through and through. doesnt matter if it hurts the individual
or not. a disorder is whenever your emotions are out of balance or do not
serve their purpose."
C41.99,"why are they against modi and rss but not against evil islam? islam teaches
muslims to kill homsexuals but i am yet to see one lgbt group even saying a
word against evil islam. why this double standard? is it because they know
muslims are not tolerant and will kill them for saying such things? isn't that
enough for your gayturds and libturds to know, that modi and rss are still
tolerant?"
C41.114,"@jin #4289369 no one is born gay. if you'll look into it deeply you'll know
its a satanic agenda promoted by elite satanists in hollywood,the music
industry etc.. i've heard it from actors and singers themselves. being a
supporter of gay rights opens the gates to accepting of worse sins like
acceptance of satanism. us gay laws were passed in 2015, one year or 2 years
later, satanism is made an official religion in us and they've built a statue
of the baphomet right in front of the 10 commandments. also it's really funny
how we are called bigots when in reality, you people support public nudity in
gay parades, and how you can support legal pedophilia (kid drag queen, desmond
is amazing, danced in a bar with dollar bills thrown on him by nude and semi
nude gay men) also we are called bigots when preachers are assaulted by gay
people on a regular basis. seriously, gay pride parades are nothing more than
public pornography. for those telling me to stop hating, first answer the
above questions. also its illegal to mispronounce your gender,or to get into a
debate with gay people,yet its perfectly legal to mock our lord jesus. several
gay celebs and gay people have mocked jesus on national tv,yet that's not
called hate. also christians don't hate gay people, but rather the sin of
homosexuality. no one is born gay,its a demonic perversion. i've talked online
and debated with members of the lgbtq community,none of them are able to
answer my question. also i've had several encounters where those people show
sick pornographic lgbt images(some loving community huh) just for engaging in
a debate. i've heard testimonies of people who used to be part of the lgbt
community, actually calling it a horrible sin. the theme of lgbt is pride, but
mainstream media which is controlled by satanic elites in hollywood and the
music industry have made us forget about god. ever wondered why so many
homosexual pedophilia takes place in hollywood? its because high ranked
directors and celebs have sold their souls, and pedophilia,rape, molestation
are ways of indoctrination into the higher levels of this society. lgbt is an
agenda supported by satanists,whom you think are atheists. its a prophecy in
biblical texts. even pope leo xiii had visions of what's to come for this
world. he saw satan telling god that he's going to control and influence the
world in the 20th century,in those visions,satan showed leo xiii visions of
war, abortion, demonic possessions, and yes homosexuality! and this vision
happened over 130 years ago,and its true. the 20th century had more deaths in
wars than all the other centuries combined,sibs became virtues, pornography
becomes so popular almost all people have seen it one way or another,
abortions have taken place in such a way that the number of dead fetuses could
fill an ocean, homosexuality becomes supported even more than christianity.
the world we live in is made to believe that god and satan doesn't exist, but
its a high level agenda done by the freemasons, kaballists,shriners, and
illumunati. they control mainstream media,they are in nasa, cia, fbi and any
government places. if you've read till here, i humbly ask you to first answer
my questions before ignorantly calling me an idiot or bigot or anything of
that sort. else, i'll consider you as a foolish ignorant nutbag who is simply
stupid"

actions are also covered. mind-blowing analysis of karma. the karmic reasons

this facts because they think they are normal, so please hetero just live your
life and don't bother or interfere in gay people private life, it's not your
problem at all. if tomorrow you will have a gay child, what will you do ??
will you love him or kill him ??? if you are from old school we can't do
anything as we are living in new school now. the first groups who always put
mess in it are religious group or old minded people. how been religious people
are you so cruel and discriminate god's child. this action is called crime,
homosexual is not crime. being terrorists killing destroying and dislike or
disrespect people are more criminal act than being gay. why you islam don't
accept that, you only making mess all around the world about this matter.
don't you have lots of muslim brothers who are gay around this world ?? they
are human and innocent. why you hate and reject them, this is criminal. if god
really hates and against homosexuality he would not create gay people on this
planet, it is you only don't like it or your religion taught you to hate
homosexuality, then you just do it. gay people never dislike you, so why you

in 2016 and lucknow is near me, so may join lucknow pride in future(didn't see
any youtube video of 2017 pride march in lucknow which i had hoped to attend).
anyways, since i also wanted to contribute to the upliftment of my gay
community i did the following:  
1\. i collected around 1400 mobile numbers of around 850 members of parliament
(the contact details are available on lok sabha and rajya sabha website). and
i wrote the following sms on these numbers:  
""sir/maam, i am a 26 year old homosexual person from u.p. homosexual people
have the same aspirations in life as heterosexual people. kindly change
section 377.""  
i received several call backs but i was too afraid to talk with an mp. though
i chatted with some of them via sms.  
2\. then, i sent all the mps a very elaborate whatsapp message in pure hindi
basically saying gays are the new dalits and homophobia is the new
untouchability. i wish i had saved that message to show you guys. i basically
made humble demand for acknowledgement, education about and protection of
gays.  
this time i received even more encouraging responses. so far so that one of
the mps asked me to visit him in his delhi office. though i excused myself out
of it because i was at lucknow, with a relative and broke. but above all,
again, too intimated to face an mp when i am a nobody and have nobody.
anyways, a lot of those mps still send me messages on festivals, etc.  
3\. i also emailed every mp on their official email id, with the concerns of
gay indians. and again received several positive responses. one interesting
thing that happened is the personal assistant of one of the mps who must have
read my mail called me and said that he has a gay family member and was asking
me how to deal with it basically.  
  
now why i am telling these things to you guys is because i believe we as a
community, the gay community need to up our game and be more focused. pride
marches are great but i am sure it doesn't reach our legislature, judiciary or
executive. so it's my request to reach out to our elected representatives in
the parliament and the supreme court judges with smses, whatsapp messages,
letters and whatnot. and also if you are a small town gay or lesbian, don't be
afraid that your family will not understand when you come out to them. i am
from ghazipur, a small town near varanasi and have a big joint family and have
told almost everyone in my family and they all understand. we have to give
them more credit. i came out to some verbally, to some through letters and to
some through whatsapp message. i also have visited several doctors in small
towns and have told them that i am gay and they all are aware and educated and
ready to help.  
  
i hope my this rather long message helps someone in someway. (feel free to ask
me how to collate 1400 mobile numbers in your phone, send messages in bulk
etc. i have done them all and will be doing them in future also)"
C41.393.1,"themarker2015 l.s india will, homosexuality has always been a part of the
indian culture"
C41.394,"i'm gay too, but i find all this advertisement of sexuality and debauchery as
nauseating. we need different kinds of campaigns, talks, something that don't
advertise sense pleasures, and sexuality and actually show gay people as
normal ppl, and an integral part of the culture and indic religion. you don't
achieve that by trying to stand out from the crowd in this fashion, importing
sjw liberal feminist nonsense."
C41.417.1,"@dinosaursrlife only one animal is gay and it is a lizard who reproduces
a-sexually but chance of pregnancy increases when it is with another female.
other then that only less than .6% of humans are gay"
C41.418.5,"i knew it !! i knew that you were gonna ask me that as your next question.
see. i clearly told you that the examples that i gave dont prove anything. so
i did not imply that choosing or not choosing are related to normal or natural
behaviour. its just that the statistics speak something. no one really knows
what it is, all the way down to the fundamentals of sexuality. and by the way,
bestiality may be just normal or natural. or it maybe just disgusting. but who
knows ? maybe bestiality is just another form of sexual orientation ! buuuut.
why should people be against it then ?? simple. because even though a person
may wanna have sex with an animal, there is no way of knowing whether the
animal also wants to have sex with the person. i told you in that previous
comment that consensual relationships are nobody's business. animals cant give
consent, coz neither can we understand them nor can they understand us. you
can end up raping the animal. so that closes the chapter on bestiality and it
must be forbidden. next question that you may wanna ask is: pedophilia ! so,
again, pedophilia may just be another form of sexual orientation. who knows ?
buuut again ! a child is not really capable of giving consent, isnt it ?
that's why we have laws in most countries about the age of consent. some
places its 16 some 18 blah blah blah. but its not 12 years old anywhere, i
guess. coz most kids are just too immature at that age, even though different
kids start maturing at different ages. no one actually knows what the right
age is. maybe we'll never know. but its reasonable to assume that kids are
mature by the time they are like 15 or 16 so that is the widely accepted age
range of consent in many countries. but it is always dangerous for a pedophile
to assume that a kid that he wants to have sex with can give him/her consent,
bcoz you dont really know if the child is old enough to think about it. thats
why sex with children should also be forbidden, well until they reach the age
of maturity, as i have been saying all along. so if an adult wants to have sex
with an animal or a child, but never acts upon his/her desires, well then that
is fine and he/she should not be criminalized in society. there is a
difference between a pedophile and a child molester. but anyway, you get my
point, i hope. now i know the next question you are probably gonna ask, but
ill wait for your reply to see if thats what it is. lol"
C41.433.1,"homosexuality is a disorder, created by a warped cognition.  
  
humans evolved with specific emotions and organs with a goal in mind. for
instance, males developed penises for reproduction. how does nature encourage
one to reproduce? sexual attraction. how does nature encourage one to
reproduce again after already done so? sexual pleasure that releases dopamine
that happens after release of sperm or female orgasm.  
  
other forms of love exist just to develop social bonds which creates a herd
group since humans are social animals. males and females were not meant to
have sex with the same sex. friendship? yes. sex in the butt or fingering? no.  
  
homosexuals that still have vaginas and penises are going against their
natural evolution and experience feelings that are abnormal in how nature
intended. biology isn't perfect (yes, psychology is biology with behaviorism).  
  
it's a disorder through and through. doesnt matter if it hurts the individual
or not. a disorder is whenever your emotions are out of balance or do not
serve their purpose."

C6.2356,"i have not seen kabir singh,and won’t see it [either.my](http://either.my/)
opinion is based on arjun reddy.i am not a feminist but really the movie is
highly misogynistic with zero respect for women and treat them as an
[object.gives](http://object.gives/) a bad message and display this as a
heroism.  
my observations:-  
\- boy goes after and gets the girl, as if she’s his private property and her
opinion just doesn’t matter.  
\- names his dog after the girl  
\- beats the girl  
\- runs after his maid to beat her for a piece of glass  
\- announces in front of the whole class that apart from this girl,every other
girl is yours in present and upcoming batches  
\- despite with all drugs and alcohol addiction,he performs his duty as a
doctor in a wonderful manner!  
there are more which i haven’t mentioned.the movie is full of these things and
sadly these acts are presented/celebrated in a heroic manner.any sensible
person won’t sympathise with this kind of flawed character who shows zero
respect for the women."
C6.2877,"movies are either engaging or they are not. that’s what makes them work or
not. as for toxic masculinity - 1. shahid has made a very bad choice & suffers
endlessly till he gives up in the extreme end & makes a change.
transformational characters have a way of connecting with audiences, come what
may. 2. let’s look at patriarchy narrative - all love stories true or untrue
have that. there’s also reverse discrimination against men in society at times
- biggest example all supposed criminals guilty of crime yet to be proved are
published with photos n names if you are a male. go look for traffic challans
- less than 5% number is female - ain’t that surprising ? all power to women -
watch bhavani bhavai, mirch masala, rudaali n many more. 3. let’s look at
patriarchy & other stupid evils as in movies - all karva chauth scenes ever,
lavish weddings n songs, success at any cost, all super fit heroes & heroines,
the list is endless. these are subliminal & vicious more damaging than
anything. 4. flawed characters are just that - characters in a story arc. we
have flawed protagonists in darr, baazigar, anjaam, devdas, dev d, raging
bull, taxi driver, wolf of wall street, a clockwork orange, so many more. it’s
just a movie. 5. do haunted houses shown means we never buy them or that
ghosts exist ? there’s free will & free choice. 6. what’s bigger cheating -
saying that you are catering to family & make movies like race3, thugs of
hindustan, zero, kalank, tubelight & cheat audience of non engaging bullshit.
or dada kondke, mithun movies which know their audience - engaged or
entertained them, though not to everyone’ s taste. but they were not cheating
their audience. 7. an actor becomes a muslim to marry 2nd time, so many actors
have extramarital affairs, so many actresses break homes & marry a married
person. nepotism, corruption is always ok when it’s personal but not in public
domain. should we be boycotting all these to set an example ? 8. i felt
disappointed when laila majnu, sonchidiya flopped & bodyguard, raja hindustani
etc. made money. in terms of technicalities & acting skills kabir singh is
good, trying a narrative which is engaging at times & cringy at others. this
will work overall for sure. why look for political correctness all the time ?

C3.301,"indian film critics mainly the female critics are bashing it because of
arjun/kabir's nature of being extra possessive, bully etc. and also blaming
our cultural set up where audiences are not at all thinking about the attitude
of the lead character and are just clapping. it's really disturbing"
C35.2,"hinduism is not against homosexuality but many hindus are...sad how they are
influenced more by the culture of the people who invaded and looted it more
than their own culture and religion..😔😔"
C35.37,"homosexuality : is it natural ?[困]  
  
not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is
believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say
that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind
of judgment on our brothers & sisters .  
  
the question that should be asked is,  
where did this perversion of this deviation come about ?  
  
cause when god created this universe & everything in this universe to obey him
& his law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the
stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in
the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created.
the planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction
of a second & astronomers can bear this witness .  
  
i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. they all obey
the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a
certain nature in which he is created.  
  
the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23°c ,30
minutes ,the planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural
inclination or leaning.  
  
man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans
towards the man.  
  
now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from?  
  
it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made
opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural
way of god & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the
natural course, his whole life style will be a deviation.  
  
the bible clearly says ,he changed the ""truth"" of god into a lie & when you
pervert the truth of god & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a
system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in africa walking
around with broken wrists .  
  
since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this
behavior.  
  
scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a
woman ,we have seen that ""thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally
on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who
thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about
him begins to change according to his thoughts.  
  
so scripture says "" behold i the sovereign lord, make all things new"" so we
must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in
which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new
thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will
reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the
expression of the man.  
  
there is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no
such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, god is here to change us all
up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were
created."

humans invented it and it is neither an illness or diseases. if it was an

that there are doctors or lawyer or pilots gay. all people not agreed with
this facts because they think they are normal, so please hetero just live your
life and don't bother or interfere in gay people private life, it's not your
problem at all. if tomorrow you will have a gay child, what will you do ??
will you love him or kill him ??? if you are from old school we can't do
anything as we are living in new school now. the first groups who always put
mess in it are religious group or old minded people. how been religious people
are you so cruel and discriminate god's child. this is action is crime, not
being homosexual. being terrorists and dislike or disrespect people are more
criminal act than being gay. why you islam don't accept that, you only making
mess all around the world about this matter. don't you have lots of muslim
brothers who are gay around this world ?? why you hate and reject them, this
is criminal. if god against homosexuality he would not create gay people, it
is you only don't like it. gay people never dislike you, and you turned
aggressive against this community. you live your live what you think is
correct and let the lgbt community also live their own life please.

make it true) and what does the evidence say? homosexuality is a normal part
of the animal kingdom and has been observed in over 1500 species. (wiki:
homosexuality in animals) there is no evidence that it is a choice. when did
you choose to be heterosexual? (assuming you are) you can certainly choose to
hide it or say the truth, but not being gay"
C35.86,"there is evidence for heterosexuality. there must be for homosexuality too.. i
am not saying that it is wrong. i am saying that it is a choice and hence
people who attack heterosexuals for saying it's not natural is not
right,because what is natural is defined by what the majority feel is natural
and what results in an outcome which is necessary for the existence of the
human species.both are necessary/"
C35.88,"quote me any scientific journal that says its a choice there is no evidence of
anybody choosing their sexuality. gays didn't choose to be gay any more than
you chose to be straight"
C35.89,"tbh i don't agree with homosexuality. in fact i find the whole sexual
intercourse between 2 men as disturbing. but that does not mean i would
victimise or be cruel to a gay person! never! that's not in my nature. but to
me, i think sexual behaviours, wether its prostitution, transsexuals and gays
are a problem for society and will soon realise why when aids is one of the
rapid spreading diseases in the world!"
C35.89.1,"dude you cant blame transsexuals they are born with organs that are not
completely of either gender that is not their fault but homosexuality is
definitely a result of life experiences and the effect of media."
C35.97,"my two cents, if the world wants to be gay let it be gay. its not my sin
neither is it my place to stop it. homosexuality amongst so meany other issues
is a world issue...let it judge its own. even the same, when the issue comes
into the church, dont be suprised that its forbidden (or at least should be).i
have refused to marry homosexuals and always will, but im not going to protest
it either"
C35.102.1,"kevin rodericks there are 4 guys in which a balt guy is the supporter of lgbt
while other three are against the lgbt community. the balt guy is saying every
person has the right to live is life on their own choice so lgbt community has
also right to live their life according to their choice while at 377 saying
that it is illegal and they will be punished by indian judiciary. the other
three guys are saying that act 377 is legal women sexual person or lgbt
community has no right to choose their partner to live their life according to
their choice. if the indian judiciary allow then too select their partner or
their life as their own conditions that will be harmful for their religious
practices sociality and for the future of india. so a person should be
punished by indian penal code if if he or she fine to involve in any kind of
homeo sexual activity also they are saying that women sexual and lgbt
community is majorly responsible for sexual disease such as its rti and sti.
ind 3% one is a catholic godsman and hindu godsman and a muslim godsman. sorry
for my bad english i hope i have arified few things in front of you."
C35.121,"thats true i belong to a christian community .. what you commented is correct
..only abrahmic faiths judaism christianity and islam opposes homosexuality
along with other unnatural sexual acts like beastiality , incest , and
adultery etc; well giving rigths to homosexuals is justice and rational in my
opinion its not unnatural"
C16.65,"it's india that a country where justice always denied to miniorties. till now
sikhs not got justice all they want sajjan and jagdish behind bars and not a
single hindu came forward only phulka stood for it still they all free vadi
vadi badka marde kuch bhi hu janda the dialogue they say 84 gona repeat..
saaleyo jidaan indra mari thi.. kiyu have u seen any religion holy place
brought army.. fucking hindus did all this and they so cowards they only
attack on groups.. the day jagdish sajjan died naturally will tell what is
justice. for sikhs it's not our country where u can't even justice.. kartarpur
pakistan giavz a gift and hindus jealous of it"
C16.82,"behen ki lodi bollywood randiyan layers of makeups and just fake attitude as
if she is a global [star.in](http://star.in/) the end all these chutiya
actress has to dance and making hot live scene as usual.without makeup they
are just so fucking ugly not even attractive as simple girls.just pretends how
cool they are but infact the these tatti actresses of world famous tattiwood
dont even know how to carry the modern dresses.just look at kajol in phalke
